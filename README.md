# GreatmixAI_CodingAssignment
My solution to  the home assignment given by Greatmix.AI

All code was writen in Python in Windows enviorment (Windows 11)

Part 1 - Surgery duration prediction

  We used the following libraries:
      numpy, sklearn, pandas, PyTorch and TabNet

  For visualization we used the following libraries:
      matplotlib, seaborn

  As we are dealing with tabular data we used decision tree based method (Extra tree) and the TabNet neural network.


Part 2 - Anesthesiologists allocation optimization

  We used the following libraries:
      pandas

  For the basic version we wrote a code which saves in the memory backwork surgries in the time frame dictated by the rules, using it to allocate rooms and anesthesiologists
  For the bonus version we created a dictionary containing for each anesthesiologist his/hers shift times. For minimal cost we need to allocate at each iteration a free anesthesiologist with the least amout of time for his/her shift.
